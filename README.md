# City-Finder (v1.1)
Android App practice with GoogleMap API

__Description__

This application reads in a list of cities then puts a marker on the map for each city. In addition, the application attempts to get the user's location if location service is enable on the device. By clicking on the map, the user can add a new marker for the location. There is also a scroller for the user to pick a city and zoom the map to that city. Clicking on multiple markers draws a line connecting the markers in the order they got clicked.
